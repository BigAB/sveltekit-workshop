The auto-adapter and the three popular cloud providers make deployment super simple.

Cloudflare Pages via adapter-cloudflare
Netlify via adapter-netlify
Vercel via adapter-vercel

They can be google but all have a way to setup CI from github, where every push to github `main` redeploys the site.

They also have their own cli's like wrangle and netlify-cli, which can be used for local development, if you are using platform specific features.
