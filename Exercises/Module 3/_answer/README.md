# Exercise for Module 3 - Add a Carousel to your blog (ANSWER)

**challenge**: Add a logo and some themed images to your blog site.

You can either use the blog from earlier or start with this demo blog.

This demo has been update with some styles and each post now has a `theme` property which is one of `'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D'` or no defined.

If you are using your previous exercise again, add a `theme` or `tag` property to the posts to decide what image to show on the post page.

For each post page, show an image of your choice for each theme.

Also, replace the link that says `Logo` with an image of your choice.
