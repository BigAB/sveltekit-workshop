# Exercise for Module 6 - Add Authorized posts

**challenge**: Add Authorized posts
Mark certain blog posts as "drafts" and only present then to the user when they are "logged in" and "have permissions"

Using the simple “login / Logout” system from Module 5 only present “draft” posts to the user when they are "logged in" and "have permissions", which may imply there is more than one user

**Hint:** use hooks and cookies to handle the “logged-in” part centrally in one place
